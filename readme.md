# restro-crud-api
A CRUD application built around Golang.
## Implemented:
1. Authentication System for login purpose.
2. An Authorization Middleware to protect enpoints.
3. REST apis to communicate with the server and handled routes using the Go's MUX router.
4. Queries to communicare with the Postgresql DB.


## AIM:  

To create a simple microservice that will implement basic functionalities for a Restaurant Management System. 

# Functionalities: 

1. To view the entire menu of the restaurant (Anyone) 

2. To view a single food item (Anyone) 

3. To add items inside the menu (Admin) 

4. To delete a food item from the menu (Admin) 

5. To modify an existing food item (Admin) 

# Roles: 

--- User: 

- A user can only view the entire menu or a particular food item using the REST call.
- Any attempt to add, delete, or modify the food menu will fail. 
- A user cannot use the login api in this current system because only an admin can login by passing his credentials to the request header. 

--- Admin:

- An Admin can call all the REST apis. 
- In order to modify the database, admin needs to authenticate himself using the login api. 
- Upon successful authentication, the admin will be granted a JWT. 
- The JWT can be used for authorization purpose to authorize the admin to make any kind of modifications to the database.
